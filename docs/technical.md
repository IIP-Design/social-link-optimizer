## Development

Please note that ESLint and PHP Codesniffer will run on every commit to ensure that the plugin's code is conforming to the correct standards. If any code fails this linting, you will not be able to complete your commit. As such it is highly recommended that you integrate ESLint and PHP Codesniffer into your preferred text editor or frequently run the linting script `npm run lint`.

To compile the plugin's JavaScript files for production, run the command `npm run build`, which will update the production files in the `admin/build` directory.

## Plugin Structure

This plugin contains a `social-link-optimizer.php` file, which registers the plugin and begins its execution. There is an admin directory (`admin`) where all functions relating to the admin portion of the plugin are registered and a public directory (`public`) where all functions relating to the plugin's frontend are registered. The `includes` directory contains the main plugin class (`include/class-slo.php`) - which defines the core functionality of the plugin, the loader class (`include/class-loader.php`) - which feeds the admin and public hooks in from their respective classes into the main class file, and activator/uninstall hooks - which define the plugin's behavior upon installation/deletion.

Below is a more detailed listing of key plugin files and directories:

## Permissions

This plugin adds a number of custom WordPress capabilities that allow site admins to manage who has access to use/configure the functionality provided by the plugin. The capabilities consist of three core capabilities for configuring social link pages and a group capabilities relating to individual social links.

The three core capabilities are:

1. `gpalab_slo_manage_settings` - Provides access to the plugin's settings page.
1. `gpalab_slo_add_slo_page` - Allows user to assign the `Social Link Optimizer` template to a page.
1. `gpalab_slo_edit_slo_page` - Allows user to update the properties of a social link page.

By default, only users assigned the role `Admin` will have these core capabilities.

The plugin also adds a group of capabilities pertaining to the creation/editing of individual social links. These capabilities correspond to the set of capabilities used to manage posts/pages and provide the [equivalent permission](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_type_capabilities/) (excluding those for private posts). They are:

- `gpalab_slo_edit_links`
- `gpalab_slo_edit_others_links`
- `gpalab_slo_edit_published_links`
- `gpalab_slo_delete_links`
- `gpalab_slo_delete_others_links`
- `gpalab_slo_delete_published_links`
- `gpalab_slo_publish_links`

By default, users with the role `Editor` and higher have access to these capabilities.

These custom capabilities can easily be integrated into any WordPress role/user management tool. In fact this plugin integrates with the [User Role Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) plugin out of the box.
